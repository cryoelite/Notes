- Advanced Data Types, that are formed by using the primitive types.
- These [[Data Type]]s are generally on the heap and are provided by the [[Standard Library]]. They  store collections of values on heap, which allows them to have unfixed size and grow dynamically. But it also means these data types take time in (de)allocation.
- All Collections can be found at [Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html)
- [[Vector]]
- [[String]]
- [[HashMap]]
