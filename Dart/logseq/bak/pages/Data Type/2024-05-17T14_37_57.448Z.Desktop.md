-For every Data type `T` exists a nullable data type `T?` which can either have a value of type `T` or [[Null]]. That is null is not assignable to `T`, Dart enforces sound null safety. Whilst ``T`` variables can be declared as uninitialized, they can't be accessed until initialized.
  FE:
```dart
String? x; //initialied to null automatically by default
String y; //un-initialized, needs to be initialized before being used
```
uses [[Variable]]s named `x` and `y`
 > We can't access properties/[[Method]]s of a nullable data type with the normal [[Operator#^ed41ea|Dot Operator]], we have to use. 
 
-Every data type's value is called an `object`. And in dart, everything in Dart is an [[Object]].
