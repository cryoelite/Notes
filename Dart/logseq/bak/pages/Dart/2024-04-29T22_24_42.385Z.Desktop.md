* [[Spec]] 
* Fast, multi-platform, null-safe (NNBD, non-nullable-by-default, introduced in Dart 2.12), strongly typed language developed by Google. Supports JIT (Compile as the app runs) and AOT (Compile everything beforehand) Compilation, and compiles natively to platforms, supports ios, windows, web (js) and android. Supports concurrency and parallelism with a first class support with [[Future]]s and [[Isolate]]s respectively. 
* Basic Program:
  In a file with extension ``.dart``, 
  FE: `abc.dart`
```dart
void main(){
	print("yo");
}
```
Executed with `dart run abc.dart`
Uses [[Dart CLI#^a56ad0|dart run]] CLI command.

* The `main()` [[Function]] is the entry-point of any dart app/project.
	It must have the [[void data type|void]] return type. And it can have an optional parameter [[List Data Type|List<String>]], this gets the arguments passed to the dart application.
	FE:
	A file `abc.dart`
```dart
void main(List<String> arguments) {

Â  print(arguments);

}
```
If we execute it with `dart run abc.dart 1 2 "yo"`
Outputs 
`[1,2,yo]` 
to the console.
* Lines have to end with `;` in dart.
* [[Variable]]
