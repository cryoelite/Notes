alias:: Document Object Model

- It is what it is named, it represents the [[HTML]] (and [[CSS]]) or [[XML]] Document as an [[Object]] and allows JS to interact with it as if it was an Object. This allows JS to freely modify the Document.
  The DOM Object has its own spec: [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)
  Similarly, we can modify the CSS classes as well using the CSSOM (creating/removing CSS classes can be done without it) which has the spec: [CSSOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/)
- The ``document`` [[Object]] is the main entry point to a page, it has the entire Document in it as an Object.
  For ex.:
  In [[Browser]]
  ```js
  document.body.style.background = "red"; //turns the background of the Document red.
  ```
  
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>About elk</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    The truth about elk.
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
  
  is represented as

  by the DOM
  Newline character and spaces between [[HTML]] tags is completely valid Objects for DOM, that is why we see them here.
- The general rule is, everything in an HTML page is a part of the DOM tree. Even the ``<!DOCTYPE...`` directive.
- There are different types of ``nodes``, each node is an [[Object]] with a specific structure, each element in [[HTML]] is represented as a ``node`` in the DOM. There's [12](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node) of these.
  The 4 most common are:
  * ``document`` – the “entry point” into DOM.
  * ``element nodes`` – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
  * ``text nodes`` – contain text.
  * ``comments`` – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.
- We can view the DOM on sites like [Live DOM Viewer](https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/) or using the [[Developer tools]].
- Navigation
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687276220476_0.png)
  We can walk the DOM tree using methods with the same name as shown above, 
  ```js
  let body = document.body; 
  ``` 
  and so on. These 3 are directly accessible.
  Note: The [[Browser]] parses the HTML document from top-to-bottom, so if we have a [[<script>]] tag before an element, then it can't see it in the DOM yet. We can have the script tag in the head tag which means the ``document.body`` itself can be [[null]]. In DOM null simply means the element doesn't exist.
  This is why it is recommended to have the script tag at the bottom.
  
  To traverse
  ```js
  let x = document.body.firstChild;
  if (x.hasChildNodes()){
   for(let child of x.childNodes) {
     console.log(child.innerText);
    }
  }
  ```
  ``<node>.hasChildNodes()`` returns true if the node has child nodes. 
  ``.childNodes`` returns an Array-like Object, called a ``Collection``, which is an [[Iterable]] so it can be looped over. However, it is advised to use ``for..of`` [[Loop]] and not ``for..in`` as the latter even enumerates over properties that aren't related to the DOM.
  
  * DOM collections are live and read-only, we can't replace a node with another node. However we can add/remove children and they represent the live state of the node in the Document. If we modify a node then its changes are rendered right away (after being called in the [[Message Queue]])
  
  * Sometimes we don't want to traverse all nodes, just specific type of nodes, for element nodes we have
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687277449222_0.png)
  The top document node is its own node, so 
  ```js
  alert( document.documentElement.parentNode ); // document
  alert( document.documentElement.parentElement ); // null
  ```
  This is useful if we wish to traverse all the way up,
  ```js
  //let elem = ... some node...;
  while(elem = elem.parentElement) {...} 
  ```
-
- Searching for elements
  We can also search for individual nodes directly.
  
  If they have an ``id`` attribute set then we can get them directly
  ```html
  <div id= "yo">
   ...
  
  <script>
   yo.style.background="red"; //ok
  </script>
  ``` 
  Or we can use the ``document.getElementById("<id>")`` method to get the node.
  It is recommended to use this method as the direct access method relies on the mixing of namespaces of JS and DOM, which means it may not be clear to the reader to understand if the variable came from the JS or the DOM and it can be easily [[Shadowed]] by any JS element as well.
  
  * ``document.getElementById("<id>")`` 
  * ``document.querySelectorAll("<css>")``: Any valid [[CSS]] selector can be used here, and then a collection of such nodes is returned. It can even use [[CSS]] pseudo-classes like ``document.querySelectorAll(":hover")`` returns the current nodes being hovered over (from the html node to the given node in depth order)
  *  ``document.querySelector("<css>")``: Same as above except only searches for as long as a single node matching the selector is found, then stops. Meaning it is faster.
  * ``<node>.matches("<css>")``: Returns a bool, true if the given node matches the CSS selector.
  * ``<node>.closest("<css>")``: Starts checking the current node, then its parent, and so on until a node matching the css is found then returns that node. 
  * ``<node>.getElementsByTagName("<tagname>")``: Returns a collection of child nodes that have the given tag. The tag can be "*" meaning any tag. 
  * ``<node>.getElementsByClassName("<classname>")``
  * ``document.getElementsByTagName("<tag name>")``: Searches the whole document and returns a collection with these nodes.
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687323010732_0.png)
  
  By ``Live``, it means that these methods return the live node, so it represents the current state on the DOM and would get updated if the DOM does, similarly, updating them would update the DOM. In contract, the ``...querySelector...`` return ``static`` elements, which don't represent the Live state of the DOM.
  
  * The ``document....(...)`` methods can be called by any Element Node as well. 
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <div>
   <span>
   </span>
  </div>
  <script>
  let div = document.querySelector('div'); 
  let span = div.querySelect('span'); //works
  </script>
  ```
  The nodes then are searched inside the given node, so only the children of a node are evaluated.
- DOM Node Classes
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687328193414_0.png)
  This is the hierarchy with the EventTarget abstract [[Class]] at the top, JS doesn't have the concept of abstract classes, it just means that by convention it is a class that shouldn't be made an object of, just inherited using [[Prototype Object]].
  EventTarget also provides [[DOM Event]]s. This is why all nodes can have an event hooked to them.
  We can use [[Console]].dir to see any node's prototypal chain.
  
  [[Browser]]s provide all these classes to the JS environment, hence we can directly check them too.
  For ex.:
  ```js
  alert( document.body instanceof HTMLBodyElement ); // true
  alert( document.body instanceof HTMLElement ); // true
  alert( document.body instanceof Element ); // true
  alert( document.body instanceof Node ); // true
  alert( document.body instanceof EventTarget ); // true
  ```
  uses ``instanceOf`` [[Operator]]
  
  Properties of these Classes:
  * ``.nodeType``: All nodes. Property, this is a [[Number]] that tells which type of node it is. As seen in the spec, [node](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node
  For ex.:
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687328592197_0.png)
  shows the nodeType of any  Element type node is 1.
  
  * ``.nodeName``: All nodes. Property which has the string name of the node type. Element Nodes also have a ``.tagName`` property which has the same value as ``nodeName``. NodeName and TagName are both basically the [[HTML]] element's name. Like a ``div`` element will have ``div`` tagname and nodename.
  
  * ``.innerHTML``: All nodes. Property which has the HTML inside the node as string. We can modify it and the changes are reflected on the page.
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <body>
    <p>A paragraph</p>
    <div>A div</div>
  
    <script>
      alert( document.body.innerHTML ); // read the current contents
      document.body.innerHTML = 'The new BODY!'; // replace it
    </script>
  
  </body>
  ```
  However, [[<script>]]s inserted inside the ``.innerHTML`` aren't executed automatically.
  Furthermore, any change to the ``.innerHTML`` of a node causes the whole node to be re-rendered. Meaning even if we concatenate a single character to the innerHTML of a node then the whole node will be rendered again, this causes hovered items to lose focus, inputted text to be wiped as well and etc. as the state is reset. If the node had a lot of resources then they will all be re-rendered so it is an expensive operation.
  
  * ``.outerHTML``: All nodes. Property which has the innerHTMl + the node's element itself.
  However, there's a slight difference between innerHTML and outerHTML.
  If we modify an innerHTML with new content, it replaces the innerHTML and the reference to the node remains the same so we can work with it. However, when we modify the outerHTML then the node's element is removed and the new modified element inserted whilst the reference keeps pointing to the old and now removed from DOM node.
  For ex.:
  ```js
  let x= document.querySelector(...);
  alert(x.outerHTML); //prints <div>...</div>
  x.outerHTML = "<p> yo</p>";
  alert(x.outerHTML); //still prints <div>...</div>
  ```
  Here, the new element is inserted and replaces the current node in the DOM but the variable still references the old one. We need to explicitly get the new reference after modifying the outerHTML.
  
  * ``.data`` and ``.nodeValue``: Text Nodes. Properties which hold their data.
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <body>
    Hello
    <!-- Comment -->
    <script>
      let text = document.body.firstChild;
      alert(text.data); // prints Hello
  
      let comment = text.nextSibling;
      alert(comment.data); // prints Comment
    </script>
  </body>
  ```
  
  * ``.textContent``: All nodes . Property that just has the text contents in it concatenated into a single string without any tags.
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <div id="news">
    <h1>Headline!</h1>
    <p>Martians attack people!</p>
  </div>
  
  <script>
    
    alert(news.textContent); // prints Headline! Martians attack people!
  </script>
  ```
  We can read/write directly using this and this doesn't cause the whole node to be re-rendered, however if there is any tag in the textContent written to the node, then it is treated literally and is not parsed.
  
  * ``.hidden``: All nodes. Hides the node if it is set to true.
  More props can be checked in the node specs.
- Additional DOM Class Properties
  This is possible too, 
  For ex.:
  ```js
  Element.prototype.yo= function () {
  };
  document.body.nah= function() {
  };
  
  console.log(document.body.nah()); //works
  console.log(document.body.yo()); //also works as document is a child to Element ([[Prototype Object]]).
  ```
  * For any attribute on an [[HTML]] element, if it is standard for the type of element then the DOM automatically keeps track of it. But custom properties must be manually fetched and updated.
  To do so we use
  ``<node>.hasAttribute(name)`` – checks for existence.
  ``<node>.getAttribute(name)`` – gets the value.
   ``<node>.setAttribute(name, value)`` – sets the value.
  ``<node>.removeAttribute(name)`` – removes the attribute.
  ``<node>.attributes``- Returns a collection with all the attributes, [[Iterable]] 
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <div id="a" yoo="bro">
  </div>
  <script>
  
  let node= document.getElementById("a");
  console.log(node.id); //ok prints a
  console.log(node.yoo); //undefined
  
  alert(node.getAttribute("a")); //prints bro
  </script>
  ```
  
  * Attribute names are case-insensitive.
  
  * The ``.outerHTML`` has all the attributes, even custom ones.
  
  * Attribute values are almost always strings. But some attributes such as ``.checked`` on the ``input`` element are boolean or some other tpe.
  
  * Almost all attribute changes made to the HTML sync with the DOM, the exception are attributes like ``.value`` on text input nodes.
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <script>
    let input = document.querySelector('input');
  
    // attribute => property
    input.setAttribute('value', 'text');
    alert(input.value); // text
  
    // NOT property => attribute
    input.value = 'newValue';
    alert(input.getAttribute('value')); // text (not updated!)
  </script>
  ```
  
  * The dataset property
  By the HTML standard, the prefix ``data-`` is left for custom attribute names. And these are all also available in the ``dataset`` property of the DOM.
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <div id="a" data-yoo="bro">
  </div>
  <script>
  
  let node= document.getElementById("a");
  console.log(node.dataset.yoo); //ok prints "bro"
  </script>
  ```
  These [[HTML]] attributes can be used in CSS as well and are automatically synced too.
- Creating and Inserting Nodes:
  To create:
  * ``document.createElement("<tag name>")``: Creates an Element type node of the given tagname. Recall that tagNames are basically the name of the element. 
  
  * ``document.createTextNode("<text node content>")``:
  ...and so on for other types of nodes as well.
  
  Now to insert the created node:
  * ``<node>.append(...nodes or strings)`` – append nodes or strings *at the end* of `node`,
  * ``<node>.prepend(...nodes or strings)`` – insert nodes or strings *at the beginning* of `node`,
  * ``<node>.before(...nodes or strings)`` –- insert nodes or strings *before* `node`,
  * ``<node>.after(...nodes or strings)`` –- insert nodes or strings *after* `node`,
  * ``<node>.replaceWith(...nodes or strings)`` –- replaces `node` with the given nodes or strings.
  They use the spread [[Operator]] so multiple nodes or strings can be inserted at once.
  Stings inserted are not parsed, so even if they contain HTML syntax, they are added `as-is`.
  
  Like so
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687454198531_0.png)
  For ex.:
  ```html
  <ol id="ol">
    <li>0</li>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
  </ol>
  
  <script>
    ol.before('before'); // insert string "before" before <ol>
    ol.after('after'); // insert string "after" after <ol>
  
    let liFirst = document.createElement('li');
    liFirst.innerHTML = 'prepend';
    ol.prepend(liFirst); // insert liFirst at the beginning of <ol>
  
    let liLast = document.createElement('li');
    liLast.innerHTML = 'append';
    ol.append(liLast); // insert liLast at the end of <ol>
  </script>
  ```
  Creates
  ```html
  before
  <ol id="ol">
    <li>prepend</li>
    <li>0</li>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>append</li>
  </ol>
  after
  ```
  
  * There is another way to insert nodes, using the ``<node>.insertAdjacementElement("<where string>", "<html string>")``, ``<node>.insertAdjacementText("<where string>", "<html string>")`` and so on.
  These methods takes a ``where`` string, which can be a value from "beforebegin", "afterbegin", "beforeend" and "afterend" and defines the position, and an [[HTML]] [[String]] which is parsed as HTML and the created node/text/etc. inserted at the given position.
  Like so
  ![image.png](../assets/image_1687454718947_0.png)
  
  * Old ways of adding nodes to DOM
   ``<parent node>.appendChild(<child Node>)``: An old method, returns the inserted node as well. 
   ``<parent node>.insertBefore(<node>, <next sibling node>)``: Same
  
  * ``document.write("<html string>")``: The html passed is parsed and then inserted right where the method was called in the HTML document. Deprecated as it can only be used while the Document is loading. If it is used after the page has loaded, it overwrites the entire Document with the given html.
- (Re)moving a Node
  ``<node>.remove()``: Removes the node and updates the DOM and [[HTML]] Document. 
  
  To move a node, we simply get the node and insert it any new place. It is automatically removed from its old place and inserted at the new place.
  
  * ``<parent node>replaceChild(<node>, <old child node>)``: An old method, returns the inserted node. Replaces the old child node with the given node from the children of the parent node.
  *  ``<parent node>removeChild(<node>)``: Same.
- ``<node>.cloneNode(<bool shouldDeepCopy>)``
  Returns a copy of the node. That is, it clones a node. If the provided bool is true, the children elements are cloned as well otherwise only the given node is cloned with all its attributes as well.
- ``DocumentFragment``
  This [[Class]] can be used to create a 'transparent' list of nodes that can be inserted anywhere, and this `wrapper` doesn't do anything.
  For ex.:
  ```js
  let x = new DocumentFragment();
  let div = document.createElement('div');
  let div2= document.createElement('div');
  x.push(div);
  x.push(div2);
  
  document.query....(...).append(...x); //works, only div and div2 are inserted
  ```
  It's not necessary to use this wrapper class, as a normal [[Array]] would work the same as well.
