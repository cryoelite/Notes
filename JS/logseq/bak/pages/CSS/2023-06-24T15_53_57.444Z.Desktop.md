alias:: Cascading Style Sheets

- It is a language to specifically define styles. We use it in conjunction with [[HTML]] to define styles for 
  it. Here's the spec for [CSS](https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css2/)
- CSS can be defined inline, using the ``style="<css>"`` attribute of [[HTML]] elements or in a seperate file.
  
  For ex.:
  For a file ``1.css``,
  ```css
  p {
    color: red;
    width: 500px;
  }
  ```
  And it is saved with ``.css`` extension. 
  Then to link a ``.css`` file and use it in an [[HTML]] Document, we use the ``link`` [[HTML Element]]
  like so
  ```html
  <link href="styles/1.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  ```
- Components of a CSS ``ruleset``
  A CSS ruleset is a combination of a selector and a declaration block which looks like an [[Object]] but is simply a block that accepts ``Key:Value;`` pairs. 
  
  For ex.:
  ![CSS p declaration color red](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png)
  is a ruleset.
  
  * The selector is matched against all elements and if an [[HTML Element]] matches the selector then the styles defined in the declaration block are applied to the element.
  We can have multiple selectors, 
  ```css
  p,
  h1,
  li {
  ...
  }
  ```
  applies the same declaration block to all multiple type of elements.
  There are more types of selectors

  Defined here: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors)
  
  * The property name and value is picked from [CSS Properties List MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). Not all CSS properties are applicable to all HTML elements and this can be quite arduous to list, so it's best to check if a CSS property is applicable to an HTML element manually. Property value doesn't necessary need to be a single value though, it can accept a single value or multiple separated by ``,`` or just using `` `` and one property can even accept multiple types of values.

- Fonts
  We can include external fonts with the ``link`` [[HTML Element]]
  ```html
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans"
    rel="stylesheet" />
  ```
  Then, use it in css like so
  ```css
  html {
    font-size: 10px; 
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; 
  }
  ```
  uses the ``CSS Sizing`` for units.
- CSS Box Model
  CSS uses the box model for defining positions and sizes of and between elements.
  It looks like so
  ![Three boxes sat inside one another. From outside to in they are labelled margin, border and padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/box-model.png)
  
  So, for any [[HTML Element]] we can define the sizes for these properties and they will be affected as shown in the box model.
  
  For ex.:
  ```css
  body {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #ff9500;
    padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
    border: 5px solid black;
  }
  ```
  sets the background color for the ``body`` [[HTML Element]] along with margin, width, padding etc.
