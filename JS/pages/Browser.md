- Browsers don't just support [[HTML]] but they also support [[XML]]. If a text document is in XML then that can be parsed by browsers too. 
  Yes the [[DOM]] works for XML based pages too.
  
  The XML mode is enabled if the Browser recieves an [[HTTP]] ``response`` with [[HTTP Header]] ``Content-Type: application/xml+xhtml``.
