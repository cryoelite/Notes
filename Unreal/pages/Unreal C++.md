- Uses the base *C++* but modifies all aspects of it, creating Unreal's own flavor of *C++*. Paired with [[Unreal Build Tool]] which is Unreal C++'s compiler.
  There are new [[Unreal C++ Data Types]], implementations for existing structures and some new features on top of C++.
  
  There's also an [[Unreal C++ Garbage Collector]] which handles memory (de)allocation at runtime.
