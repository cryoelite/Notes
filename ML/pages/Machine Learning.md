- "Field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthur Samuel
  
  Basically we program the computer in such a way that allows it to solve other problems without being explicitly being told how to solve them. Such as the ability to identify people in an image or chat with people like [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) etc.
