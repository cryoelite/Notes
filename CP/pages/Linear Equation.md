- Degree 1 [[Equation]]. 
  Can be 1 [[Variable]] , like $$2x+9=0$$
  Or 2 variable such as $$2x+9y=0$$
  or 3 variable $$2x+9y+3z=0 $$ 
  and so on.
- General form
  $$f(x) = ax+b$$
  where a and b are [[Real Number]]s and ``a!=0``
- Intercept
  If the [[Line]] of [[Function]] f on the [[Virtual Plane]] intersects the *x-axis* at (a,0) then (a,0) is an *x-intercept*. For *y-intercept* it should intersect at (0,b) and similarly for other dimensions.
